@techreport{Barbacci2003,
	abstract = {The Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW) is a facilitated method that engages system stake- holders early in the life cycle to discover the driving quality attributes of a software-intensive system. The QAW was developed to complement the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Meth- odSM (ATAMSM) and provides a way to identify important quality attributes and clarify system requirements before the software architecture has been created. This is the third edition of a technical report describing the QAW. We have narrowed the scope of a QAW to the creation of prioritized and refined scenarios. This report describes the newly revised QAW and describes potential uses of the refined scenarios generated during it.},
